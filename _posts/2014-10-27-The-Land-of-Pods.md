I was flying standby, there was possibly room, but if not I had to be prepared to sleep in what is according to many the most uncomfortable airport terminal to sleep in, LAX. 

I had figured I would purchase a pass to one of the airline member clubs typically they are open until around midnight to 2 am, and from there just rough until they opened again at 6am. Price, 60.00+USD. Sounded like a solid plan, though it was creeping up on what it would have cost to simply get a hotel. The difference was lugging around 70 lbs of nearly everything I owned of value. That part sounded like the sucky part. 

And then while waiting, a spot opened up on the flight to Tokyo. 

A night in Tokyo sounded way better, so I quickly confirmed and waited to to see if I would get issued a ticket. Luck was on my side, boarding pass in hand I quickly checked what my baggage storage options were in Narita and what sort of options I would have for sleeping. As fun as it can be to be down town Tokyo at night, I really wanted to stay near the airport because of the travel time back and forth can take a hour or more, needed to be back at the Airport in the morning. 

Enter Hotel 9 hours. 

Pod sleeping, which I had never done. Price 3,000 Yen. Experience pretty priceless. Not only do they offer you a comfy pod with speakers for your own music to sleep to, adjustable light, and all that trim. Additional things included in the price: spacious lockers for storing your luggage, a shower, with included soap, and towel. Open 24 hours with a check out time of 10AM. 

As pictured at the top its a wall that seems to go on forever like some sort of Borg hive or what not. Sleeping arrangements are uni-sex however each sex has their own changing area I believe. Perfect if like me you need to over night cheaply at the airport because you need to catch another flight, or if your flight leaves super early and you don't want to fight the morning train commute. Over all it was extremely different to have people sleeping around you and while you have privacy lets be honest you don't, its not like some hatch closes that seals you off from the rest of the world. 

I would do it again, without a second thought.
