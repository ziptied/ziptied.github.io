A man has passed away. 

I suppose with each passing year we grow older, the greater the likelihood that we will need to attend a funeral. This is just a mathematical truth, hopefully it isn't anymore tragic than it needs to be as it happens. I am in Japan less than a week and I am paying my final respects to man with family. That in itself I believe makes it tragic in nature, although he is older, still young by Japanese standards however. 

Really as I broke it down he wasn't but a few years older than my own father. A man that for the past year had been close to the edge himself, enduring a major open heart surgery and another tricky heart surgery. My father now healthy, like an ox some would say, is only a few years younger and has had similar but different health issues. 

Both suffering from heart related issues, the difference  being while my father suffered heart attacks, this man here in Japan suffered strokes. The first of which left him with a slight paralysis in his face. This is how I remember him because I didn't have the pleasure to know him before the first stroke.

Embarrassed by his slight paralysis to strangers, more so with a foreigner like myself perhaps. But still a kind happy man, who loved to grow fruit trees in pots, and walk his dog, momo-chan #2. 

Walking his dog is in fact when I first met him. He apologized for his slur caused by the paralysis and explained it made it hard to understand him. Though not really in my option. 

This is who I choose to remember him. There are many other options and things to recall about him. Such as he was a bonito fisherman by trade, who I really wish I had the opportunity to go fishing with and hear some stories and wisdom.

The funeral process here in Japan, is really nothing unexpected in the beginning if you know much about the country. It's a finely crafted tradition refined over, who knows how many years, but a lot. There are a few rules, some similar to western funeral practices. 

1. The body shall never been left alone. 
2. Incense will always be burning, but only one, as additional incense sticks will apparently cause the deceased spirit to have a more difficult time on its travels. 
3. Food offerings are made, through out this process and the 49 day period following cremation. 
4. I am sure there are many more, I just wasn't informed as they didn't apply. 

I stayed with the body the first two night, waking up with an alarm on the hour to replace incense and provide a quick prayer. Other than the lack of sleep from sleeping on a tatami mat with just a thin futon cushion, it wasn't a bad experience. Cleansing in a way for me. Providing a slight push in a much needed direction. After each night, family would come and bring me breakfast, and some snack food, and then more family would come and relieve me of my post until later that night. 

The funeral itself is broken into two days. The first day service is during the evening allowing anyone that can not come during the day an opportunity to pay their respects. The second days service is during the day, and is open to anyone. 

There is a very particular way that respects are paid to the dead in Japan. You get up, bow to the immediate family, then to the extended, then approach the casket bow to the monk that is chanting, then another step closer to the casket. This is where you grab a dab of ground wood from a box, with two fingers, raise it to head, then place it in another little box next to it that burns the wood like incense. You repeat this process three times before finally praying to the deceased, then repeating the approaching process in reverse. 

There might be variations with this process or different ones all together, this was just the one I was shown. 

On the second day, after everyone has completed this process, family gathers and is given all the flowers from the display around the coffin and proceed to place them in the coffin with the deceased. Care is given not to cover the face, but otherwise flowers are packed tightly inside. This process seems to serve as the final goodbye for everyone. Up until this point, most emotion was controlled and there were only a few tears. However during the placement of flowers, everyone, and I mean everyone is balling their eyes out. 

Following this the casket is closed, sealed, the monk pronounces the new name and rank for the person who has passed and says a few things about the passed. 

Then the close family loads up with the casket drives to the crematorium. 

At this point if being an outsider invited along during the process leading up to this wasn't a bit overwhelming the next bit really was. 

The monk met us at the crematorium, and chanted while we moved the casket to a hallway with many number chambers, which I found out are all cremation chambers. The family bows and prays, and the monk chants while the casket is wheeled into a chamber, and the door closes sealing it in. I then could feel the intense heat, even through the solid door. 

Following a goodbye to the priest we were all led to a waiting room where there was a feast ready for us. Delicious food was had, drinks and cheers all around while we waited. Everyone in the family at this point seemed to be celebrating or that is how I choose to think of it. The language barrier was intense, and with only 2 people able to speak any english present, translation was impossible for most conversations.  

After a while, a bell rang out, which seemed to the signal to use that the cremation was complete. 

Now this part is where things were intense. We were led to another room. As we filed in, we were given long chopsticks. Two family members went into another room and then a few minutes later everyone else was asked to follow them in. This is where I see the human skeleton exactly where, if anything I expected only to see ash.

Its explained that we are going to take turns taking the bones with our chopsticks and placing them in the waiting urn. I am pretty uncomfortable about this, its a bit far on the very edges of my comfort zone. 

As I watch we take turns in order of family rank, until its my turn. I am gestured to come and take my turn and honestly all I can think of is "don't drop the bone, whatever you do, do not f'in drop the bone you pickup".

We are working from the feet up so I select what I assume is a foot or ankle bone and carefully place it into the urn. We repeat this in order working our way up from the feet to the skull, pausing only when the urn is full and a worker uses his own chopsticks crush the bone down to make room. Finally the worker breaks apart the back of the skull and sides, carefully places them inside. Finally the face are of the skull is placed in and he marks which direction it is facing out. 

Once complete we again all load up into cars, drive to his house to setup a shrine where the urn will sit with daily offerings and incense for the next 49 days. Following that I was told there will be another ceremony involving the monk where the urn will be placed into the family tomb. 

An incredible experience, that I am very grateful I was allowed to be apart of, though tragic and sad that it was happening to begin with. 

Being apart of the process has as it does for many I assume, awaked a bit of spirituality in me. So much so that I am considering completing the 88 Temple pilgrimage in respect and to see where that takes me
