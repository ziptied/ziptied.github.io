The past few years have been a renaissance of craft beer in the United States. And kudos to the the beer brew masters that are digging up beer making recipes from 600 years ago and attempting to brew it again for a modern crowd of eager beer junkies. I am one, with the exception that I really am tired of hoppy flavor. 

Yebisu beer, sorry if you are outside Japan, the only place currently you can enjoy this treat. Is a great, delicious refresher of beer without the quad hoppy taste. I am not a beer wikipedia of how beer is brewed and the different ingredients everyone is using. So I can't tell you what all goes into the different Yebisu beers but I can tell you that they all taste great.

Particularly I would like to call out the cream stout. It was some of the richest creamiest beer I have ever had. Just thick and meaty enough but super clean finishing flavor with a hint of nuts. Sadly this is a nitro cask beer only, so not available in cans or bottles. Sadness 'cause I wouldn't mind this being stock in the fridge for a while or being able to just grab one at the convince store whenever. 

In this Yebisu bar in Osaka, something else I would like to call out, of note. The coasters. Yes those things that most of us put our beer on and don't give a second thought about. Here as the beer sweats or the frost melts and drips down to the coaster, the fluid causes a water mark to slowly reveal itself on the coaster. Sweet.
