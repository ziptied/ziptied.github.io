We have all done it, you just want a quiet dinner, suddenly you wake up on a fishing trawler in Alaska on day 2 of a 14 day trip. It happens, you pause, and recall the events that led you to your indentured servitude. You smile as you remember everything, and then the captain barks at you for day dreaming on the job. 

Ok it wasn't that crazy in action but in food absolutely.  I believe I have earned a little pride in both the things I have eaten and the things I have tried and enjoy. I am picky about food, it must be good. After that, well as my roundness can attest, I am pretty eager to give it a go. 

The night in question was meant to be quiet, a quick bite of food and maybe try what ever local beer, sake they had available. I was thinking maybe some yakitori or some bonito to eat and call it good. 

Bonito season is still in full swing so I have been trying to enjoy it as much as possible. It is after all my favorite fish to eat and the locally caught stuff is just amazing in flavor. 

Upon entering the bar, I hear everyone say they only speak Japanese when they look over and see me. Not exactly welcoming but not scaring me away either. I grab a seat and order a sake and some bonito when the owners wife comes over to hand me a hot towel. 

I love that the hot moist towel is a custom here by the way. Saves a trip to the bathroom simply to wash your hands.

The bonito that comes out, is like the filet mignon of bonito, what was always good, is not ruined by the absolutely melt in your mouth cuts that are delivered to me. I nearly forgot to take a picture of it, that is honestly how good it looked and tasted. 

The sake, great as well, really paired well with the bonito with a dry mouth and a slightly lingering after taste. 

The chef/owner comes out from behind the bar to check on me and act a little goofy while trying to interact with me. Impressed by my thoughts on the fish, I deduced that he wasn't expecting me to appreciate it like that due to me being a foreigner from the US. He says he has something he would like to prepare for me. I tell him, surprise me, thinking that if the basic fish is this good what isn't on the public menu has got to be amazing. 

I finish my sake and get another while I wait, while other patrons in the bar attempt to talk to me. For only speaking Japanese they were pretty good at dropping the occasional english words at me. Sometimes they make no sense and I think they are just repeating what ever they know regardless of meaning. Entertainment. 

The next plate arrives and the chef explains that if I can guess the meat in the middle the dish will be free for me. Challenge accepted!

I give it a little bite, it was super soft, I thought at first that it was whale. It sorta start to melt in my mouth, and it was frozen, like my last experience with whale sashimi was. But whale I was told was not the correct answer but he eagerly motioned for more guesses. 

After looking closer at the meat I realized it was not fish at all. It looked nothing like any raw fish I had ever seen. I ate a few more bits and then I remember that Dennis told me at some point that they eat horse in Japan, even raw. Bingo. I am the big winner! 

Even more impressed the chef brought me a bowl of Oden and said he was going to make something else special. Another glass of sake arrives, bought for me by another patron at the bar. I thank him and everyone else in the bar, and get laughs this time for some reason. 

Although my Japanese is starting to improve its still pretty shitty, I can't recall if I miss pronounced something but it wouldn't surprise me if that was the source of the laughs. 

Next up, a bowl of fish meat with two big bits of bone. I smile thank him and he starts to walk away saying it is Fugu. My mouth drops. Shit. How much do I trust this guy. 

I am familiar with the fish and am very aware of just how poisonous it is. The chef gets back behind the bar, and laughs, points at the dish, mimes out falling asleep and then makes the ambulance sound laughing.

Well this dinner just got high stakes. Fugu has a nasty neurotoxin, a pin head worth is lethal. About 1200 times more deadly than cyanide and there is no known antitoxin. A single fish has enough toxin to kill 30 people. Meaning if he made any mistake, beebuuu beeebuuu is likely going to be the last thing I hear in this life.

So I dig in. 

Oh and how tasty it is, light flavored but dense meat, flakey and completely drizzled in a soup stock sauce that  itself was really delicious.

I suck the meat off the spines drain the bowl, ready for another. Instead I bowel of snails arrives and I am beginning to feel like a test subject. Is everyone just trying to see if there is something I don't like or won't eat. The snails are excellent as well, tender just how I like them.

Another sake later, with pretty much everyone having left, the chef comes out sits down with me and sets up a game board I have never seen in my life. He explains he wants to teach me Shogi. It seems that my night of culture exchange via food isn't over. 

We setup the board and he shows me how each piece moves, and we start playing. I realize quickly that I didn't memorize the Kanji well enough as I quickly loose a few pieces to him. Then I discover that captured bits can be placed back on the board in service of the person that captured it. Mind blown.

I put up as good of a fight as I can, but it was a game of of delaying my loss and trying to punish him as much as possible before the end. 

Next we played a simpler game with the same pieces that mimicked western checkers. I fair much better, and we quickly are locked in a speed match of trading pieces. Though a few sake in I make a mistake and it costs me the game. Still excellent fun. 

That was the end of the night, I thanked him and he asked me to come back some time and play again. Which I took as a honest request and I just might have to, after I study up on Shogi a bit! This level of friendliness and hospitality is why I loved me previous visit here. Its easy to make friends and they are eager to share the local life.
